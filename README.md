> Although implementation of this project is my own version, it influenced a lot from [Building an immersive creative website from scratch without frameworks](https://www.awwwards.com/academy/course/building-an-immersive-creative-website-from-scratch-without-frameworks) course. As the instructor inspired me to implemented on my own instead of doing exactly what he did, I found out the performance can't be that good because of fetching from server again and again whenever the url change even though browser doesn't refresh. Although I could manage to avoid this by changing inner html on every pages with only one server request on load, I lost sytax highlight on html codes inside js and intellisense(very important to me as I prefer tailwindcss and no intellisense would take my time alot). Also I think dom manipulation on my own rather than letting frameworks do could be more expensive. So, I decided to give up implementation the project with vanilla typescript and trying for single page application from scratch and switch over to react or vue..
